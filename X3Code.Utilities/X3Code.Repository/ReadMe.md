# X3Code.Repository

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This library is currently in an experimental state.

## Overview
X3Code.Repository is a lightweight library that provides a flexible and easy-to-implement repository pattern for .NET applications. It's designed to work seamlessly with Entity Framework while remaining database provider-independent.

## Features
- üéØ Generic repository pattern implementation
- üîå Database provider agnostic
- ü§ù Entity Framework integration
- üß± Easy-to-use base repository classes
- üì¶ CRUD operations out of the box
- üé® Flexible and extensible design

## Installation
```shell
dotnet add package X3Code.Repository
```

## Quick Start
1. Define your entity by implementing `Entity<T>`. This class inherits from `IEntity<T>` and will implement you primary key with the type defined.
```csharp
csharp public class Product : Entity<T> 
{
    public string Name { get; set; } // Other properties... 
}
```
The type defined in here will be used for the EntityId Property. So, if you choose `Entity<Guid>` you will get
```csharp
public Guid EntityId { get; set; }
```
if you choose `Entity<int>` you will get
```csharp
public int EntityId { get; set; }
```
etc

2. Create an empty interface for your repository and inherit from `IBaseRepository<T>`
> This will make it much easier, to handle the repositories and add them to the DI-container
```csharp
public interface ICustomRepository : IBaseRepository<Custom>
{
    
}
```

3. Then create the corresponding repository. You need to inherit the `BaseRepository<T>` and your self created `ICustomRepository`. With this trick, you repository class stays clean and easy. You can add functionality if needed.
```csharp
public class CustomRepository : BaseRepository<Custom>, ICustomRepository
{
    public VehiclePartRepository(DbContext context) : base(context)
    {
    }
}
```
> If you need access to the DbContext or the Entity, you can use the inherited properties
> ```csharp
> protected DbContext DataBase { get; }    
> protected DbSet<TEntity> Entities { get; }
> ```

4. Add your Repositories to the DI-Container
5. Register your Entities to the Db-Context

## Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 or later
- Entity Framework Core

## Usage Examples
```csharp
// Register in your DI container
services.AddScoped<IRepository<Product>, ProductRepository>();

// Inject and use in your service
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IRepository<Product> _repository;

    public ProductService(IRepository<Product> repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _repository.GetByIdAsync(id);
    }
}
```
